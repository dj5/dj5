### Hi there, I'm [Dhananjay Gavade](https://github.com/dj5) 👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/), with a passion for data engineering and machine learning. Here are some highlights of my journey so far:

- 🔭 Recently I worked at [Raven Industries](https://www.ravenind.com/) as a Data Engineer Intern, where I developed machine learning models for autonomous agriculture vehicles and building data pipelines using Apache Airflow and AWS services.

- 🌱 I've previously worked at [Michelin](https://www.michelin.in/) as a Data Engineer, where I developed forecasting models and improved data processing efficiency.

- 📚 My academic background includes courses in Big Data Management, Data Mining, and more. I also published a paper on hospital resource management.
- 📈 I'm a Data Enthusiast and I have worked on Data Science and Data Engineering projects
- 💡 I'm passionate about Machine Learning, and I recently worked on a project that used Reinforcement Learning to optimize Kubernetes pod scaling on GCP.
- 🏆 I'm good in winning Hackathons and coding competitions. I have participated and won many national and international hackathons.
- 💊 I developed a predictive model to forecast medicine needs for hospitals, winning first place in the Smart India Hackathon.
